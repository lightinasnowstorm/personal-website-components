react components from my personal website

https://hitomi.sakurako.now.sh

Note: JA and EN are just empty components defined with `({ children }) => <>{children}</>`

Feel free to use these components!
The website is supposed to have a theme based on half-remembered websites I've visited, but it's remembered oddly and I like it.
